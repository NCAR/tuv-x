Code of Conduct
===============

We welcome your contributions! However, the MUSICA software development team,
the folks responsible for developing TUV-x at NCAR, enforce certain software standards
which can be found in our `software development plan <https://github.com/NCAR/musica/blob/main/docs/Software%20Development%20Plan.pdf>`_.

In particular, we reserve the right to reject pull requests if the new additions
would have TUV-x fall out of line with our standards:

1. Be runtime configurable
2. Acheive 80% test coverage (your PR must at least not decrease the current number)
3. Build as a standalone library
4. Include documentation
5. Have a common style.

The project maintainers will work with you when submitting a PR and give guidance
on how to update a PR if any issues arise.
